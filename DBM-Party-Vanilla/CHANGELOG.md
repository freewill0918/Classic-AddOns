[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Dungeons/compare/r184...r185) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Dungeons/releases)

- Update localization.ru.lua (#385)  
- Update koKR (#388)  
- KarazhanCrypts/Kharon: Upgrade MC warning to special warning  
    I initially thought the MC would be obvious enough to not warrant that, but from my experience with pugs, it seems to be necessary.  
- KarazhanCrypts/Kharon: Add 5 minute enrage timer  
- KarazhanCrypts/Kharon: Stop yelling when MC is broken early  
- KarazhanCrypts/Trash: Fix special warnings for standing in fire being filtered by "easy" dungeon filters  
- KarazhanCrypts/DarkRider: Fix warning to attack mirror images  
    Update text from "Ghost" to "Mirror Image" because they don't really look like ghosts  
- KarazhanCrypts/DarkRider: Fix spammy warning for last horse phase
