Search for Deth'tilac around the area.
|tip It is level 30-35, depending on your level.
|tip Note that this will be much easier as Survival, with talents into Entrapment, Trap Mastery and Resourcefulness.
You will need to use a pet with a snare effect in order to tame this, as well as beat him down to _20%_.  We suggest using a spider pet.
Start with laying down a _Snake Trap_, followed by an _Ice Trap_ behind it.
Send your pet in, sacrificing it.  Once Deth'tilac kills it, he'll trigger your _Snake Trap_.
While Deth'tilac is attacking the snakes, cast _Revive Pet_.  Once the snakes are all dead and Deth'tilac has triggered _Ice Trap_, sacrifice your pet again.
Repeat the above steps until Deth'tilac is at _20%_ health. Be sure to _Dismiss your pet_ at this point.
Use your Tame Beast ability on _Deth'tilac_. |cast Tame Beast##1515 |goto Molten Front,66.60,72.70
