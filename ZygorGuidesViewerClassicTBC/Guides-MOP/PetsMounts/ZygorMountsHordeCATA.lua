When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.

Move out of it as quickly as you can, as the Parasites will spawn out of it.
If a parasite touches you, you will become infected and fail the achievement.

A shaman with _Reverberation_ as a talent will be able to solo interrupt.
_Magmatron_ will use an ability called _Acquiring Target_ which will be aimed at a random raid member.
For this, you will want the raid group spread out as much as possible.

When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.

An Argent Champion runs up on a horse
Use the abilities on your hotbar to defeat the Argent Champion|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

Fight and defeat them
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Champion riders is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Champion rider (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible).  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Champion rider will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible), then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

An Argent Champion runs up on a horse
Use the abilities on your hotbar to defeat the Argent Champion
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.
