Avoid the Orange Areas on the Ground
|tip Overlord Drakuru will toss orange crystals at you, which will explode and create orange areas on the ground that will damage you badly.
|tip Try to avoid the orange areas on the ground, while trying to help your Blightblood Troll minion damage Overlord Drakuru, as much as you can.
|tip The orange areas on the ground will start to disappear after some time, so try to position yourself so that they don't infect too much of the ground.

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.

|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!
