|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

Welcome to the Zygor Speedleveling Guide!
|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!

|tip This guide will not behave like our other guides.
|tip This guide automatically detects experience bonuses like heirlooms and Joyous Journeys, and accounts for you running dungeons and deviating from the guide.
|tip The guide is always calibrating your best experience/hour and will throttle you forward in the guide if it detects a better location for you.
|tip Don't be alarmed if steps disappear or you have to abandon quests, that is the guide working as intended.
|tip If you wish to experience zones in their entirety or finish a quest chain, use the normal leveling guides. Once you're done, re-open the Speedleveling guide.
|tip It will account for the experience you gained and automatically recalibrate you to your highest experience per hour zone!
