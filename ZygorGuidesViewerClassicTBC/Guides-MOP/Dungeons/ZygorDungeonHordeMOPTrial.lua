kill Thalnos the Soulrender##59789
|tip Thalnos will Raise Fallen Crusaders. This ability summons zombies that the tank needs to pick up. When the Fallen Crusaders hit you, they leave behind Mind Rot which is a DoT that can stack.
|tip He also summons Spirit Gales often. These are puddles on the ground that should not be stepped in. This ability is interruptable.
|tip Evict Soul is a debuff that Thalnos throws on a random party member. This DoT needs to be dispelled as quickly as possible.
|tip He will also use Summon Empowering Spirit. This ability will summon an add that DPS should kill as quickly as they can. If this add reaches a Fallen Crusader's corpse, it will spawn an Empowered Zombie.
|tip Empowered Zombies are large zombies which need to be tanked. They cannot be killed without great focus.

_Phase 1_
|tip Commander Durand will fight you alone.
|tip He uses Flash of Steel and Dashing Strike. Both of these abilities cause him to jump to party members quickly, but neither do much damage as long as the group is spread out.
|tip When Durand dies, phase 2 begins.
_Phase 2_
|tip High Inquisitor Whitemane will come and and begin to fight.
|tip She will cast Power Word: Shield, Smite and Heal. Make sure to interrupt Smite and Heal.
|tip Whitemane will also try casting Mass Resurrection. DO NOT LET THIS CAST FINISH!! If this cast finishes, all corpses within 100 yards will resurrect and aggro.
|tip After you weaken her she will cast Deep Sleep. This puts the entire party to sleep for 10 seconds, during this time she will resurrect Durand.
_Phase 3_
|tip Now you will have to fight the two together.
|tip Kill Whitemane first, make sure to interrupt Smite and Heal
|tip Stay spread out for Durand.
